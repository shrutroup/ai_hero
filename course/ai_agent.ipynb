       " '## 5. Design the Test suite\\n\\nTo compare new answers with old ones, we need evaluation metrics. You can use deterministic or embeddings-based metrics like Semantic Similarity. However, you often need more custom criteria. Using **LLM-as-a-judge** is useful for this, letting you define what to detect.\\n\\nLet’s formulate what we want to Tests:\\n\\n* **Length check**. All new responses must be no longer than 200 symbols.\\n\\n* **Correctness**. All new responses should not contradict the reference answer.\\n\\n* **Style**. All new responses should match the style of the reference.\\n\\nText length is easy to check, but for Correctness and Style, we\\'ll write our custom LLM judges.\\n\\n### Correctness judge\\n\\nWe implement the correctness evaluator, using an Evidenty template for binary classification. We ask the LLM to classify each response as \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" based on the `target_response` column and provide reasoning for its decision.\\n\\n<Note>\\nYou can also use a built-in `CorrectnessLLMEval()` to use a default prompt.\\n</Note>\\n\\n```python\\ncorrectness = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\n        criteria = \"\"\"An ANSWER is correct when it is the same as the REFERENCE in all facts and details, even if worded differently.\\n        The ANSWER is incorrect if it contradicts the REFERENCE, adds additional claims, omits or changes details.\\n        REFERENCE:\\n        =====\\n        {target_response}\\n        =====\"\"\",\\n        target_category=\"incorrect\",\\n        non_target_category=\"correct\",\\n        uncertainty=\"unknown\",\\n        include_reasoning=True,\\n        pre_messages=[(\"system\", \"You are an expert evaluator. You will be given an ANSWER and REFERENCE\")],\\n        )\\n```\\n\\nWe recommend splitting each evaluation criterion into separate judges and using a simple grading scale, like binary classifiers, for better reliability.\\n\\n<Info>\\n  **Ideally, evaluate your judge first!** Each LLM evaluator is a small ML system you should align with your preferences. We recommend running a couple of iterations. Check the [tutorial on LLM judges](/examples/LLM_judge).\\n</Info>\\n\\n<Info>\\n  **Template parameters.** For an explanation of each parameter, check the [LLM judge ](/metrics/customize_llm_judge)docs.\\n</Info>\\n\\n### Style judge\\n\\nUsing a similar approach, we\\'ll create a custom judge for style match: it should look whether the style (not the contents!) of both responses remains similar.\\n\\n```python\\nstyle_match = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\n        criteria = \"\"\"An ANSWER is style-matching when it matches the REFERENCE answer in STYLE, even if the meaning is different.\\nThe ANSWER is style-mismatched when it diverges from the REFERENCE answer in STYLE, even if the meaning is the same.\\n\\nConsider the following STYLE attributes:\\n- tone (friendly, formal, casual, sarcastic, etc.)\\n- sentence structure (simple, compound, complex, etc.)\\n- verbosity level (relative length of answers)\\n- and other similar attributes that may reflect difference in STYLE.\\n\\nYou must focus only on STYLE. Ignore any differences in contents.\\n\\n=====\\n{target_response}\\n=====\"\"\",\\n        target_category=\"style-mismatched\",\\n        non_target_category=\"style-matching\",\\n        uncertainty=\"unknown\",\\n        include_reasoning=True,\\n        pre_messages=[(\"system\", \"You are an expert evaluator. You will be given an ANSWER and REFERENCE\")],\\n        )\\n```\\n\\nThis could be useful to detect more subtle changes, like LLM becoming suddenly more verbose.\\n\\nAt the same time, these types of checks are much more subjective and we can expect some variability in the judge responses, so we can treat this test as \"non-critical\".',\n",
       " '## 6. Run the evaluation\\n\\nNow, we can run tests that evaluate for correctness, style and text length. We do this in two steps.\\n\\n**Score the data**. First, we define the row-level [descriptors](/docs/library/descriptors) we want to add. They will process each individual response and add the score/label to the dataset.\\n\\nWe\\'ll include the two evaluators we just created, and built-in `TextLength()` descriptor.\\n\\n```python\\ndescriptors=[LLMEval(\"response\",\\n            template=correctness,\\n            provider = \"openai\",\\n            model = \"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n            alias=\"Correctness\",\\n            additional_columns={\"target_response\": \"target_response\"}),\\n     LLMEval(\"response\",\\n            template=style_match,\\n            provider = \"openai\",\\n            model = \"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n            alias=\"Style\",\\n            additional_columns={\"target_response\": \"target_response\"}),\\n    TextLength(\"response\", alias=\"Length\")]\\n```\\n\\n<Info>\\n  **Understand Descriptors**.

For that, we need a Report with the added tests.\\n\\n**Create a Report**. Let\\'s formulate the Report:\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    TextEvals(),\\n    MaxValue(column=\"Length\", tests=[lte(200)]),\\n    CategoryCount(column=\"Correctness\", category=\"incorrect\", tests=[eq(0)]),\\n    CategoryCount(column=\"Style\", category=\"style-mismatched\", tests=[eq(0, is_critical=False)]),\\n])\\n```\\n\\nWhat happens in this code:\\n\\n* We create an Evidently Report to compute aggregate Metrics.\\n\\n* We use `TextEvals` to summarize all descriptors.\\n\\n* We also add Tests for specific values we want to validate. You add Tests by picking a metric you want to assess, and adding a condition to it. (See [available Metrics](/metrics/all_metrics)).\\n\\n* To set test conditions, you define the expectations using parameters like `gt` (greater than), `lt` (less than), `eq` (equal), etc. (Check [Test docs](/docs/library/tests)).\\n\\n* We also label one of the tests (style match) as non-critical. This means it will trigger warning instead of a fail, and will be visually labeled yellow in the Report and the monitoring panel.\\n\\n<Info>\\n  If you want to test share instead of count, use `share_tests` instead of `tests`.\\n</Info>\\n\\n**Run the Report**. Now that our Report with its test conditions is ready - let\\'s run it! We will apply it to the `eval_dataset` that we prepared earlier, and send it to the Evidently Cloud.\\n\\n```python\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\nws.add_run(project.id, my_eval, include_data=True)\\n```\\n\\nIncluding data is optional but useful for most LLM use cases since you\\'d want to see not just the aggregate results but also the raw texts outputs.\\n\\n<Info>\\n  You can preview the results in your Python notebook: call `my_eval` or `my_eval.json()`.&#x20;\\n</Info>\\n\\nTo view the results, navigate to the Evidently Platform. Go to the [Home Page](https://app.evidently.cloud/), enter your Project, and find the Reports section in the left menu.

       " '## 8. Get a Dashboard\\n\\nAs you run multiple Reports, you may want to track results in time to see if you are improving. You can configure a Dashboard, both in UI or programmatically.&#x20;\\n\\nLet\\'s create a couple of Panels using Dashboards as code approach so that it\\'s easy to reproduce. The following code will add:\\n\\n* A counter panel to show the SUCCESS rate of the latest Test run.\\n\\n* A test monitoring panel to show all Test results over time.\\n\\n```python\\nproject.dashboard.add_panel(\\n     DashboardPanelTestSuiteCounter(\\n        title=\"Latest Test run\",\\n        filter=ReportFilter(metadata_values={}, tag_values=[]),\\n        size=WidgetSize.FULL,\\n        statuses=[TestStatus.SUCCESS],\\n        agg=CounterAgg.LAST,\\n    ),\\n    tab=\"Tests\"\\n)\\nproject.dashboard.add_panel(\\n    DashboardPanelTestSuite(\\n        title=\"Test results\",\\n        filter=ReportFilter(metadata_values={}, tag_values=[]),\\n        size=WidgetSize.FULL,\\n        panel_type=TestSuitePanelType.DETAILED,\\n    ),\\n    tab=\"Tests\"\\n)\\nproject.save()\\n```\\n\\nWhen you navigate to the UI, you will now see a Panel which shows a summary of Test results (Success, Failure, and Warning) for each Report we ran. As you add more Tests to the same Project, the Panels will be automatically updated to show new Test results.\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_regression_tutorial_dashboard-min.png)\\n\\nIf you hover over individual Test results, you will able to see the specific Test and conditions. You can click on it to open up the specific underlying Report to explore.\\n\\n<Info>\\n  **Using Dashboards**. You can design and add other Panel types, like simply plotting mean/max values or distributions of scores over time. Check the [docs on Dashboards](/docs/platform/dashboard).\\n</Info>\\n\\n**What\\'s next?** As you design a similar Test Suite for your use case, you can integrate it with CI/CD workflows to run on every change. You can also enable alerts to be sent to your email / Slack whenever the Tests fail.']"
